# quasar-definitions
[WIP] Quasar Definitions in object format

This is just a placeholder project that will focus on defining legacy Quasar changes.

The current Quasar objects will be generated via the Quasar JSON API.

These two concerns will then be merged into a finalized singularity which will/can be used for:
1. eslint-plugin-quasar
2. TypeScript generation
3. others

Help is appreciated in maintaining and/or double-checking consistency, spelling mistakes, and correctness.

TODO: need a schema (currently it has been ad-hoc, but I have tried to be consistent)

Discussions can be done in the Issues area.
